ML is a multi line which is set of paralel lines. On different distances each in separate dash and colour configuration.   
DBJ MDL is a tool for drawing very complex "multilines". MLD files are Multi Line Definitions. These lines are most often used by drafters to represent schemas with complex cable trunking.
DBJ MDL places MLines in 3d space. 

MLD.ENV also makes this tool available to the DBJ RUN AtuoLISP env for plugins runtime.  

Requires running AutoCAD and AutoLISP.
